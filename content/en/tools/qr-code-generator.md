This tool allows you to generate QR codes for direct download links to be imported into your ePoc mobile application.

It supports converting share links from the following services into QR codes:

-   Google Drive
-   Dropbox
-   GitHub
-   Or any direct link to an ePoc zip file ([guide](https://bytesbin.com/file-hosting-direct-download-link/) to get a direct link)

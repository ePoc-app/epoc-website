To integrate an evaluation into your training path, you need to click on the question button in the side toolbar, choose a question type, and then drag and drop from the side toolbar to the editing area.

The evaluation can be done in two ways:

- Simple question: a single question asked in the normal flow of the chapter without changing context.
- Multiple question activity: the activity launches in a new context and the learner must answer a whole series of questions before getting their score or badge.

There are currently five types of questions:

- [Single/Multiple Choice](./question/choice.md)
- [Drag and Drop](./question/drag-and-drop.md)
- [Reorder](./question/reorder.md)
- [Swipe](./question/swipe.md)
- [Dropdown List](./question/dropdown.md)

## Introduction

The learning events described below are based on the **[xAPI](https://registry.tincanapi.com/#home/verbs)** standard. These events track user 
interactions with educational content. They can be used by the **[badge system](./evaluation#badge)** to reward progress, by the **content 
locking system** to control access to resources, and soon for **branching scenarios** to define conditions for 
obtaining, unlocking or branching content.

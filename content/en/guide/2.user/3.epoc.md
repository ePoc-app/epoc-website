Creating an ePoc requires filling out a few parameters in a form (located on the right side of the screen) to customize certain aspects of the training. To access the "About the ePoc" window, click on the ePoc icon (located at the top left) in the central part. You'll notice that when the icon is selected, its outline turns blue.

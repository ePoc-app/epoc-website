## Share Your ePoc

To be able to view your new ePoc in the mobile application, you need to host it on a service accessible from the internet (Cloud, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, etc).

Once it's uploaded, you can generate a QR Code with [our online tool](/en/tools/qr-code-generator) to import it from your mobile application.

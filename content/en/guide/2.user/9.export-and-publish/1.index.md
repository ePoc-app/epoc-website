## Publish Your ePoc

Once your ePoc is complete, you can publish it as an archive readable by our mobile application.

It's very simple:

::steps{level=5}
##### Click on the export button in the top right
##### Choose a location and filename
::

![Export ePoc](/images/export-epoc.gif)

## Share Your ePoc

To be able to view your new ePoc in the mobile application, you need to host it on a service accessible from the internet (Cloud, Nextcloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, etc).

Once it's uploaded, you can generate a QR Code with [our online tool](/en/tools/qr-code-generator) to import it from your mobile application.

## Universal Link

It is possible to create a universal link to download an ePoc on the app without going through the direct import inside the ePoc application.

To create this universal link, you simply need to add a part to the current download URL of your ePoc, namely: `https://epoc.inria.fr/app-redirect/dl?url=`.

For example, if the current URL of your file is:
`https://files.inria.fr/LearningLab_public/epocs-prod/E006PE/E006PE.zip`

You need to transform it into:
`https://epoc.inria.fr/app-redirect/dl?url=https://files.inria.fr/LearningLab_public/epocs-prod/E006PE/E006PE.zip`

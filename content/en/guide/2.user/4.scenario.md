The particularity of this editor is that the proposed graphical interface is very visual. The ePoc is composed of chapters which are themselves composed of pages containing different types of content (video, text, quizzes, etc).

## Link Pages

Chapters have a red dot and pages have two red dots on each side. These red dots allow you to connect pages to each other and to a chapter, according to the educational path to integrate them into the mobile training.

**Warning**: It is impossible to preview unconnected content
::

To link two existing pages, place your mouse cursor on the red dot next to the first content and hold down the mouse button. Drag your mouse to the other red dot of the second content and release the mouse button. A black arrow connecting the two contents will appear.

In the WYSIWYG editor, you can write LaTeX code. Currently, LaTeX preview is not available in the editor, but you can view the result in the mobile application. To get a preview of your course while writing your LaTeX expressions, you can launch the preview simultaneously with the editor.

## Delimiters
To write your expressions, you need to use delimiters at the beginning and end of your expression. Here are the delimiters to use:

- `$$` To start an expression in "display" mode
- `$` To start an expression in "inline" mode

In summary, "display" mode makes symbols larger, suitable for a distinct line, while "inline" mode makes them smaller, integrated into the text. In "display" mode, equations are centered and don't have automatic line breaks unless specified. In "inline" mode, line breaks are allowed after certain symbols or operators.

## Examples

::tabs
    ::div{label="Display Mode"}
    ```latex
    $$ \sum_{p = 0}^{2n + 1} (-1)^p $$
    ```

    $ \sum_{p = 0}^{2n + 1} (-1)^p $
    ```

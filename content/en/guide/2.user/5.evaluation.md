## Introduction
Once your scenario is designed, you can configure the evaluation system for your training program. Two evaluation systems are available:

1. **Badge System**:
   Badges allow you to mark the learner's progress by rewarding the completion of specific steps (e.g., a chapter or successful completion of a series of questions). The certificate of achievement is unlocked when the learner earns a certain number of badges, configurable in the ePoc settings. This certificate will include:
    - The title of the ePoc
    - The learner's name
    - The list of badges earned
    - The issuance date
    - A unique identification number

2. **Point-Based System**:
   Each question can earn points. The certificate of achievement is unlocked when the learner reaches a defined point threshold. This certificate will include:
    - The title of the ePoc
    - The learner's name
    - The issuance date
    - A unique identification number

You can choose the system that best fits your pedagogical needs.

## Score
Each question in your program can be assigned a score. Here's how to configure points for a question:

- **Point Allocation**:
  For each question, you can define the number of points awarded for a correct answer. This allows you to weight the importance of questions in the overall evaluation.

- **Success Threshold**:
  In the ePoc settings, you can define the point threshold required to unlock the certificate of achievement.

The data format of the `content.json` file is a JSON schema defined using TypeScript classes, types, and interfaces.

To learn more about the data format, we invite you to use the ePoc classes (v1) available for download from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@epoc/epoc-types).

```bash
npm i @epoc/epoc-types
```

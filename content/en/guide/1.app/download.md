## Alternative Stores

### F-Droid

We understand that some users prefer to use alternative stores like F-Droid. However, submitting our application to F-Droid requires specific configuration that demands significant work from our team. For this reason, we have not yet submitted our application to F-Droid.

### Aurora Store

However, our application is available on Aurora Store, another alternative store that is itself available on F-Droid. You can download Aurora Store from F-Droid and then search for our ePoc application.

To download Aurora Store from F-Droid, follow these steps:

1. Open F-Droid on your Android device.
2. Search for "Aurora Store".
3. Download and install Aurora Store.
4. Open Aurora Store and search for "ePoc".
5. Download and install our ePoc application.

We hope these instructions help you download and install our ePoc mobile application. If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to contact us for assistance.

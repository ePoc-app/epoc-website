We strive to promote the creation and animation of communities around our ePoc mobile learning solution, by encouraging communication, participation, and meetings.

## Tchap and Discord channels for communication

The main channels for information, news, and exchanges within the community are our dedicated Tchap and Discord channels for ePoc. Tchap is the most active main channel, as our community includes many public service agents. These are also the preferred places to welcome newcomers and those who want to learn more about the project. If you use ePoc, we invite you to register and participate in these discussion channels.

- Register for our [ePoc Tchap channel](https://www.tchap.gouv.fr/#/room/#epoc:agent.education.tchap.gouv.fr)
- Join our [ePoc Discord server](https://discord.gg/xzSVeuPEtH)

## LaForgeEdu forum

In addition to instant messaging channels, we offer a dedicated category on the LaForgeEdu Discourse forum. This forum is the ideal place to share your creations, get mutual help between members, and benefit from technical support.

Instant messaging channels like Tchap and Discord allow direct exchange with the community and developers, facilitating quick and immediate interactions. On the other hand, Discourse is more oriented towards asynchronous and long-lasting discussions. It allows keeping a written trace of exchanges, which is beneficial for the community in the future. Discussions on Discourse are better organized, with clear topics and structured responses, making it easier to find information and solve recurring problems.

## Events to meet

We attend many events throughout the year, including the Journée du Libre Éducatif, AlpOSS, Tech&Fest, NEC, and JRES. These events are ideal opportunities to exchange ideas, share thoughts, and strengthen community bonds.
